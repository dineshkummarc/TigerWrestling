<span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; font-size: medium;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">The Tigers Wrestling Club has three basic levels of membership.&nbsp;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
<ol>
    <li style="margin-left: 15px;">The<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><strong>Tiger Cub</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>program is a less structured program meant for newbies and younger wrestlers<strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>(in second grade and earlier primarily)</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>It meets for practice two days a week on Mondays and Wednesdays.<br />
    </li>
    <li style="margin-left: 15px;">The<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><strong>Full Tiger Wrestling Club<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></strong>is open to all ages of kids but is tailored to those who have wrestled before or might be new to wrerstling but have a level of athletic proficiency that will allow them to keep up with a fairly rigorous practice schedule. It primarily focuses on kids in the<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><strong>second grade level up through middle school</strong><strong>Tiger Cub</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>program which is geared toward kids who have never wrestled and are looking to get their feet wet.&nbsp; It meets a couple of days a week, (Monday and Wednesday) from 5:30-7:30 and is a little less structured than our full club membership.&nbsp;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><strong>Full Club</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>runs three days a week (Monday, Tuesday and Thursday) from 6-8 and is intended to be a more focused and more demanding, instructive environment where most (but not all) of the wrestlers have wrestled before.&nbsp; New kids are certainly welcome in both programs and we encourage kids who are in second grade and up to consider the full club approach just because it is around then that competition starts to heat up. Any kid can begin in the tiger cubs program and if the coaches feel is is more appropriate to move them over to the full club they will approach the parents and discuss it. <br />
    </li>
    <li style="margin-left: 15px;">Finally we also have a<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><strong>middle school program</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>that is held the same nights as our full practices and focuses on kids who are in their middle school program and would also like to increase their exposure to tougher wrestlers. Kids in this program must also be enrolled in their school's middle school program for wrestling and will as a result recieve a discount on their fees because of less face to face time allowed with club instructors.<br />
    </li>
</ol>
We wrestle as part of the<strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>Illinois Kids Wrestling Federation (IKWF)<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></strong>and our competitions are held at venues sanctioned by this body.&nbsp; We adhere to the rules and guidelines they have set up.&nbsp; Specific to questions about ages and weights, the IKWF divides wrestlers into classes.&nbsp; Here they are...along with some rules<br />

<br />
Know that the weight classes listed above for Intermediates and up only refer to the state series at the end our season.Typically, the boys compete week to week using what we call blocked weights where the kids are grouped together in weight classes according to who shows up at a meet on Sunday morning. That usually means less that a pound or two between kids in each group until you get into the upper weight regions where there may be more disparity.<br />
<br />
In our club all ages wrestle together at practice but wresting partners are paired based on weight and age and relative skill level when possible.&nbsp; All practices are held at the&nbsp; Wheaton Warrenville South High School wrestling room.<br />
<br />
We always encourage parents to get their kids to ask friends to join them who are of similar size as it makes for an familiar partner but we also split kids up so that they learn from other wrestlers and don't get stuck in a rut at practice.</span></span>
